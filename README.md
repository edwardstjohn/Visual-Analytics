Visual Analytics - Analysis on London House Prices for Data Science MSc.

In this research project we aim to explore the different factors behind recent trends in London house prices and sales volume, assessing different factors such as interest rates and Stamp Duty Land Tax reductions (and subsequent reduction extension announcements). The results highlight that these factors do appear to directly influence both price and sales, however caution must be drawn to distorted results during Covid-19 as there are likely to be some effects shown in the market that appear to be due to our factors but may actaully be caused by a simple lack of demand and supply due to Covid.
